          <h3>Apr 2025 – Started Learning Hindi</h3>
          <p>After much procrastination, decided to stop playing video games and use the time to learn Hindi language. From books, began practicing basic sentences with my Indian friends who helped me along the way.</p>

          <h3>May 2025 – Singing to the Rhythm</h3>
          <p>Surprised some friends that I am learning Hindi. My sabse accha dost challenged me to learn a new Hindi song, I accepted the challenge for fun and realized I have a talent for it. And my first ganna learnt is tu hain toh which I also sang to my boss as her farewell song 😭. I then went on to learn a couple of Hindi songs across genres!</p>
